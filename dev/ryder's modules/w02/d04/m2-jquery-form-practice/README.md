# More Practice with jQuery and Browser Storage

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Create HTML forms and store user input in the browser
- Read and write data with localStorage and sessionStorage
- Understand the pros and cons of using built-in browser storage

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- Write basic HTML/CSS
- Read and write basic vanilla Javascript
- Have a basic understanding of browser storage

## Instructions:
This lab will take you through a series of exercises intended to illustrate the thought process about how to develop code based on a complex technical requirement. You will be provided a series of challenges, each of which builds on what you did in the last one. The files are located in a separate repo: [jquery-forms-lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-26/jquery-form-lab)

Please fork and clone this repo in your local dev environment.

_(Note:  Do not send pull requests when code is designed to live on separate branches.)_

Open `index.html` in your browser and follow the instructions in `script.js`. Checkout the next step after you get each piece of the project working. Each version of the script file contains detailed instructions about how to proceed through the exercises.

Let's do the first few challenges together until you get the hang of things.

If you get stuck, ask for help, or move on to the next step. The focus is on understanding what is happening, not on intuiting everything at first glance.


### Question to consider:

Why can you create new Date, Array and String objects but not a Math object?
